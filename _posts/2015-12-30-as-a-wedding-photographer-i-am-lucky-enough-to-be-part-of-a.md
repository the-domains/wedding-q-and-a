As a wedding photographer, I am lucky enough to be part of a vast amount of a couple's big day, with anything from preparations up until the 1st dance. We get to spend time in planning and get to know the day very well. I am offering answers to any questions people may have about their upcoming wedding.

You don't need to sign up to anything, just use \#QandAWeddings in twitter or Instagram.
